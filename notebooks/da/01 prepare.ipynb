    "## Ambiguity\n",
    "Several words can be spelled in more than one way. For example, the Danish word for aquarium, \"akvarium\", can also be spelled *akvarie*. This causes ambiguous rules. If we naively added both \"akvarie\" and \"akvarium\" to our lemmatizer and then tried lemmatizing \"akvarier\" (plural form of \"akvarium\"/\"akvarie\"), the lemmatizer would not know whether to return \"akvarium\" or \"akvarie\". It would then return both words and let the user pick the desired one. In some scenarios, this might be the desired behavior. But here, we will try and avoid the ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We avoid this kind of ambiguity by choosing one spelling over the other. It doesn't matter too much which spelling we choose as long as we are consistent. In general, when we can easily identify the more 'modern' spelling, we favor that one. In the caae of the aquarium, \"akvarie\" has only recently been accepted and so we will choose that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"-ium\"/\"-ie\" endings are quite common and so we will  scan the DSN word list to make sure we handle all of them. We do this by grouping the word list by full form. We then look for groups that contain exactly two lemmas with one ending in \"ium\" and the other in \"ie\". From these we keep only the lemma ending in \"ie\". This ensures that we learn to lemmatize, for example, \"akvarier\" unambiguously to \"akvarie\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not done yet, though. What should happen if we lemmatize \"akvarium\"? One option is to just return \"akvarium\" since the word is already in its base form. Another option would be to return \"akvarie\" to reflect that we have chosen that form over \"akvarium\". One might argue in favor of the first option by saying that turning \"akvarium\" into *akvarie* is the job of a normalizer and consequently should not be done by the lemmatizer. On the other hand, leaving different lemmas for different spellings of the same words was what we wanted to avoid. We have chosen to go with option two, lemmatizing \"akvarium\" to \"akvarie\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the disambiguation code is run only during preprocessing of the training (and test) data. If you prefer not to disambiguate in this way, you can skip that part of preprocessing and train your own rules."

    "## Other Ambiguity\n",
    "We have now removed words with two accepted spellings. Unfortunately, we have at least one more kind of ambiguity left in the data, namely distinct words which share one or more forms. For example, the Danish word \"se\" means *see*. Past tense of \"se\" is \"så\" (somewhat similar to *saw*). But the word \"så\" also has another meaning in Danish, namely *sow*. Consequently, if we are to lemmatize the word \"så\" and do not have any other information, we cannot tell whether the lemma is \"se\" or \"så\". For these situation, it helps if we know the POS tag of the previous word of the sentence. Therefor, we now identify ambiguous words which are still present after the above cleaning of ambiguous words. For these ambiguous words, we then build a list of tuples which include the POS tag of the previous word."
